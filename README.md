# IO Mapbox Challenge

## Getting Started

Uses nodejs 12.0.0.  Install using `asdf-vm`:  
```
asdf install
```
Install all dependencies:  
```
npm install
```

## Starting the Server
Build the bundle and start the server:  
```
npm run start
```

Building the bundle can take some time, you can build without minifying:  
```
npm run start-dev
```

When the site is up, listen for the server on `localhost:1000`
